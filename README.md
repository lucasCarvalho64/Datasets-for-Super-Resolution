# Datasets for Super Resolution
Masters Degree in Informatics Engineering - Dissertation

Each dataset contains 12800 images.
The images are already crooped to 192x192 HR and 48x48 LR.
The Low Resolution images of General, Domain and Unreal datasets were obtained by bicubic interpolation with anti-aliasing.

## General
A combination of 3 popular Super Resolution datasets (DIV2K, OutDoorScene and Flickr2K).

## Domain
A combination of forest images from the Flickr website.

## Unreal
Screenshots from 3D forest made im Unreal Engine 5.

## Real LR
Screenshots from the same Unreal 5 forest, but the LR images were generated directly by the graphics engine.
